# About iro / 色

色 (iro) means color in Japanese.

iro started a color palette app that began as a recap project during my Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische in October 2024.

This project marks my first experience developing a React app from scratch. I embraced the opportunity to apply all the knowledge I had at the time. I utilized it to develop my first component architecture and front-end logics.

As I continue to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and React, I regularly revisit this project to incorporate new concepts and improve its functionality.

Working on iro taught me valuable lessons about long-term project maintenance and continuous improvement. 

What started as a learning exercise has developed into a platform for implementing new features and refining initial design decisions.
